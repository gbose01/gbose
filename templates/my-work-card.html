        <h2>Startups</h2>
        <h4>Redwood DAO (2022)</h4>
        At Stanford, I co-founded Redwood DAO, a web3 investment syndicate comprised only of Stanford students. We collectively invest our pool of $50K in early web3 startups via public token sales.
        <h4>WiiQare (2021)</h4>
        I spent 3 months advising the founder of a FinTech app in Central Africa on all matters relating to fundraising and product strategy.
        <h4>Healthier Finance (2020)</h4>
        In the height of the pandemic, I formed a team of students to build a one-stop shop website for California residents to find financial resources to support economic recovery.

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <h4>Gbose.me (2022)</h4>
        I built this website using Python Flask and am hosting it on GCP App Engine. My goal is to migrate it to a personal webserver running on my raspberry pi.
